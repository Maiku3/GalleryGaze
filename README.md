## What is this application?
This is a full-stack web application that I have developed using Pug Template engine for the front-end, and Node.js and Express.js for the back-end. The database that I used is MongoDB with Mongoose.

## Demo Video:
Here is a demo of the website: [https://youtu.be/1O0RyE4KtGs](https://youtu.be/1O0RyE4KtGs)

## How to setup and run the application:
### To be able to run this locally, you will need to already have MongoDB set up.
1. Download all the modules with the command: npm install
2. Make sure mongodb is running, then initialize the database for the web application with
the command: node database-initializer.js
3. Now run the server with the command: node server.js
4. It will be on hosted on localhost with port 3000, type http://localhost:3000/ or
http://localhost:3000/home to get to the home page

## Potential Improvements
- Utilizing a framework like ReactJS as it is modular and will make the UI better.
